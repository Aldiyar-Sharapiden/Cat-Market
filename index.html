                <p>The Persian cat (Persian: گربه ایرانی‎, romanized: Gorbe Īrānī) is a long-haired breed of cat
                    characterized by its round face and short muzzle. It is also known as the "Persian Longhair" in the
                    English-speaking countries. In the Middle East region, they are widely known as "Shirazi cats" and
                    in Iran they are known as "Shiraz cat". Recognized by the
                    cat fancy since the late 19th century, it was developed first by the English, and then mainly by
                    American breeders after the Second World War. </p>
